\chapter{Conclusion \& Futher Work}
\label{ch:conclusion}
This chapter discuss the query expansion implementation and compares it to Rudihagen's implementation.
Lastly, the writer suggest possible improvements to futher increase performance.

\section{Futher Work}
After implementing a query expansion which requires two round trips there is still room for improvement.
To achieve only one round trip the author suggest one of the two following solutions:
use Elasticsearch's scripting functionality to evaluate custom expressions \footnote{\url{https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-scripting.html}},
or implement query expansion in Lucene and expose the feature in Elasticsearch's API.
