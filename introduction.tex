\section{Motivation}
Personalized search are used by multiple companies with a different degree of complexity.
Spotify offers Discover Weekly, Netflix when suggesting new movies, Amazon shopping cart recommendation.

User retention. Personalized content generates higher user retention degree. [find reference for this statement].

Today's services are not able to handle cold starts.
Services like Netflix and Amazon needs time and user data to generate user profiles to be used in personalization. [Maybe not relevant]

User is able to notice latency which is greater than 100 ms. It is therefore important to deliver results within 100 ms.
Google did experiments on users with different latencies. Users which experienced a latency of 0.5 second, generated 20\% less traffic.

An earlier master thesis on this topic implemented a recommendation engine which was able to give better search recommendations.
However the implemented solution experienced a latency of up to 600 ms.
In this thesis we will explore the possibility to reduce the search latency to beneath the 100 ms mark. [Instant, personalized search recommendations]

\section{Problem specification}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item How to provide instant personalized recommendations on a cold start based on the query typed?
  \item Does the personalized recommendations give better results for the user?
  \item How to make the search recommandation scale with an increasing amount of users?
  \item How to provide search recommendations within 100ms?
\end{enumerate}
